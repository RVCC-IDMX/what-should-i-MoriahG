# AI collaboration summary

## Project overview

**Domain:** Pets

**AI tools used:** Github Copilot GPT-4.1

---

## Data creation

### What I asked AI to help with

I asked Copilot to help generate more pets for my data.js file.

**Prompt:**
> Generate 15-25 more pet items for the options array with the same properties as the first two. Make them vary in animal type, such as amphibians and reptiles.

### What I verified or changed

I had to search up a few animals since it decided to name some niche specific breeds of animals that I didn't know, but upon looking them up, I verifed what they were and kept them because I recognized they were common pets. The AI did give somewhat inaccurate properties to the animals, such as poor temperament classifications and life span averages that I had to fix.
