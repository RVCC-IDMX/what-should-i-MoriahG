# What should I...?

A personalized recommendation tool built with JavaScript.

## About this project
**URL:** https://moriahg-dream-pet-discovery.netlify.app

**Domain:** Pets

**Question:** What pet should I get?

**Description:** This recommendation tool helps users decide which pet is best for them based on their preferences and needs.

**Why?:** There are many lonely people looking to fill the void in their hearts. What better way to do that than to adopt a pet? But with so many animals out there, it can be hard for one to know all the options and which animal is best for them. Especially with the harsh sterotypes around owning certain animals, such as all cats being independent, leading to people being blindsided by the reality of owning that pet after they get it, often resulting in them neglecting their pets or giving them up.

## How it works

1. User selects pet preferences from the form
2. Matching functions filter the data based on preferences
3. Recommendations are displayed on the page
